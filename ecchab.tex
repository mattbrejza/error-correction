I shall start off by introducing the simplest type of error correcting code to demonstrate the concept. As shown in Figure~\ref{}, a repetition code duplicates the data $n$ times before transmitting over the channel. At the reciever, the decoder then takes the majority vote to decide on the value of the orginal bit. 

We can improve the performace of this repetition code by changing the way the recieved bits are represented in the decoder. While previously we have represented recieved bits in the decoder as either `1' or `0', we can instead represent bits by their probability of being a `1' or a 0'. \acs{LLR} to represent the recieved bits, it will be shown th
